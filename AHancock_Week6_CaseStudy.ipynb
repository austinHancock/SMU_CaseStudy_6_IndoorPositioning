    "Wireless networking has allowed us to bypass Global Positioning Systems (GPS) in spaces where the signals do not reliably work. Indoor Position Systems (IPS), which use wireless local area networks (LAN), use WiFi signals from network access points to determine near real-time information about connected devices. Initial IPS construction requires reference data that contains spatial and signal strength information around a fixed set of access points, known as routers. Once the training data is analyzed, a model can be created to predict the location of a new, unknown device that is connected to the IPS as a function of the detected signal strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this case study was taken from the companion website for the 'Data Science in R' book written by Nolan and Lang, which is referenced below in the [References](#References) section. To summarize, the raw data was taken from a Community Resource for Archiving Wireless Data At Dartmouth (CRAWDAD) site. The reference data set is termed the \"offline\" data set and is used to train our prediction model. The data \"contains signal strengths measured using a hand-held device on a grid of 166 points spaced 1 meter apart in the hallways of one floor of a building at the University of Mannheim. The floor plan, which measures about 15 meters by 36 meters, is displayed in Figure 1.1\" (Nolan & Lang, 4). The grid can be seen below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='http://www.rdatasciencecases.org/GeoLoc/images/building.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, x, y, and orientation information about the hand-held device is included in the data set. In total, 110 signal strength measurements were taken at 8 circular orientations (45 degrees separated) to each of the 6 access points on the figure above. The media access control (MAC) lists the MAC address of the hardware, which gives a unique identifier to a piece of hardware on a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The format of the data is as follows:\n",
    "* t=\"Timestamp\";\n",
    "* id=\"MACofScanDevice\";\n",
    "* pos=\"RealPosition\";\n",
    "* degree=\"orientation\";\n",

    "A real-time location system (RTLS) is a system which uses wireless technologies to determine the location of a target in real-time. With the proliferation of IoT (internet of things) enabled devices in recent years, the ability to gather RTLS data indoors has increased significantly. To correctly gather and use this RTLS data, it is important to both understand the monitoring technology being used and how the location of a target is determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case study, we will be analyzing data gathered through an IPS comprised of a number of routers within a single floor of a building. We will be creating a model to predict an observation's location based on the signal strength, in dB, and angle of the observation in relation to the 6 access points within the IPS."

    "When deciding which MAC address to keep, we looked at both the contour plot and the errors in prediction. The contour plots showed greater signal strength in the \"00:0f:a3:39:e1:c0\" MAC address than in the \"00:0f:a3:39:dd:cd\" address for the angles we tested with. The knn model we used to calculate prediction errors revealed that the \"cd\" MAC address produced less errors, but was only marginally better than the \"c0\" address. Given this slight difference in predictive capabilities using our first prediction model, we decided to keep the \"c0\" address due to its greater signal strength and continue the analysis with \"00:0f:a3:39:e1:c0\" as our access point.\n",
    "\n",
    "After we had our 6 access points we added weights based on signal strength to our knn model to try and improve its predictive capabilities. To compare the differences in accuracy of models based on the number of nearest neighbors it uses in the location calculation, we created two models; knn=3 and knn=5. The knn=5 model produced better predictions which confirmed our k-fold cross-validation check which showed that using 5 or 6 nearest neighbors would be more accurate than 3 nearest neighbors. While using 5 to 6 neighbors gives us better results than using 3 neighbors in a weighted model, the unweighted model still produced the best results."

The additional look into the resulting k-nearest neighbor predictions, as well as analysis of signal strengths through the use of contour plots, allowed us to more confidently state which MAC address was the one mapped to the contested access point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the use of k-fold cross-validation enabled us to determine the number of nearest neighbors to use for our prediction model. While we were able to successfully determine how to improve the predictions of our knn model by tuning the number of neighbors we applied weights to, we were unable to use this model to produce better predictions than the unweighted model. To improve our predictions, it might be helpful to use different distance calculation methods or a different weighting function."
